Community Training provides various tools and functionalities to help you easily create, manage, and monitor learning activities for training programs.\r\n14. \r\n15. To make it simple for new users to get started with Community Training, you can use the following step-by-step implementation guide. It covers how to configure the learning platform, upload content, onboard users, select learner endpoints, track progress, and measure learning outcomes using the management portal.  \r\n16. \r\n17. ## Step 1 â€?Sign in to the portal\r\n18. \r\n19. Select the **Get Started** or **Sign In** button to create an account or sign in. You can sign in with your social account (email address), or Azure Active Directory account as defined at the time the platform is deployed from Azure Portal.  \r\n20. \r\n21. ![sign in](../media/sign-in.png)\r\n22. \r\n23. When signing in for the first time, you will be asked to complete your profile information.\r\n24. \r\n25. ![create profile](../media/create-profile.gif)\r\n26. \r\n27. > [!TIP]  \r\n28. > The profile information users need to provide at the time of sign-up can be customized from the management portal.\r\n29. \r\n30. ## Step 2 â€?Switch to administrator view of the portal\r\n31. \r\n32. Once you sign in to the portal, by default, you will be shown the learner view. Select the **user icon** on the top right of the screen and select the **View as an administrator** option from the drop-down menu to open the management portal.  \r\n33. \r\n34. ![View as admin](../media/View%20as%20admin.png)\r\n35. \r\n36. The management portal provides all the administrative functions like course management, user management, tracking and monitoring through analytics, portal settings, and more. It is designed based on [**role-based access control**](../get-started/user-role-and-management-portal-overview.md). This means that features are only available to users based on whether they have been granted the right permissions.\r\n37. \r\n38. ![Role-based access](../media/image%28426%29.png)\r\n39. \r\n40. > [!TIP]  \r\n41. > After logging into the management portal, it is recommended to [**add administrators**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md) and delegate portal management and configuration to other users in the organization.\r\n42. \r\n43. ## Step 3 - Customize the training portal\r\n44. \r\n45. You can personalize the training portal by configuring various elements of the interface and user settings. To do so, use the **Settings** tab in the management portal:\r\n46. \r\n47. * You can customize the [**look and feel of the portal**](../settings/customize-the-look-and-feel-of-your-portal.md)  to reflect your organizationâ€™s branding including the portal name, logos, color themes, banners, and messaging.\r\n48. \r\n49. * You can also [**create additional profile fields**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md) to capture user information at the time of sign-up.\r\n50. \r\n51. * Lastly, you can [**restrict portal access**](../settings/restrict-portal-access-to-users-outside-your-organization.md) to  unauthorized users and protect your training content.\r\n52. \r\n53. ![settings overview](../media/settings-overview.gif)\r\n54. \r\n55. ## Step 4 â€?Upload training content to the portal  \r\n56. \r\n57. Community Training is optimized for learning with videos for mobile devices â€?even on low-bandwidth or while offline. It provides an easy way for your organization to create and manage online courses, and offer a seamless learning experience.\r\n58. \r\n59. Courses in Community Training are created under categories. These categories can be based on topics, professions, skills, and more. Courses on the portal will have one or more lessons, non-graded assessments, graded assessments, and certifications.\r\n60. \r\n61. ![Upload content to portal](../media/Upload%20content%20to%20portal.png)\r\n62. \r\n63. To add learning material to your training portal, you need to [**define a category**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-category.md)  and [**create courses under that category**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-category.md). You can do this from the **Content Tab** in the management portal. When you create a new course, remember the following:\r\n64. \r\n65. 1. The course name should be simple and clear. Users should instantly understand the topic of the course when they read the title.\r\n66. \r\n67. 2. Write a description so your users will have a clear idea of what they will learn in each course.\r\n68. \r\n69. 3. Upload a customized image relating to the course topic to provide a visual cue to learners. Try to create different thumbnails for each course, to the avoid the redundancy of using the same image.\r\n70. \r\n71.  Once you have created the courses, [**add learning materials**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/upload-content-to-a-course.md) like videos, PDF files, PowerPoint files, YouTube links, and more. Additionally, [**manage the course options**](../content-management/manage-content/manage-course-category/manage-users-for-a-course.md) according to your needs. Lastly, [**add assessments**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-assessments-to-a-course.md) before [**publishing the course**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/publishing-course.md) for your learners.\r\n72. \r\n73.  ![create course gif](../media/create-course-gif.gif)\r\n74. \r\n75. > [!TIP]  \r\n76. > Use [**bulk upload course**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-3---create-multiple-courses-in-a-category) to quickly upload your training content on the portal.\r\n77. \r\n78. ## Step 5 â€?Create a group and onboard learners to the portal  \r\n79. \r\n80. Go to the **Users** tab in the management portal to start onboarding learners to the platform. To quickly add learners to the platform, create a CSV file containing the userâ€™s data and [**bulk upload users**](../user-management/organize-users/add-multiple-users-to-the-group.md) to the portal. Bulk upload simplifies the process of adding many users at a time.\r\n81. \r\n82. In case you have to onboard and manage a large user base, you should also [**create groups**](../user-management/organize-users/create-a-new-group.md) to organize your users based on their job profile, location, designation, and more. Additionally, [**add users**](../user-management/organize-users/create-a-new-group.md#manually-add-users-to-group-during-creation-time) manually into these groups. Once you have added users to a group, you can [**assign courses**](../user-management/manage-users/assign-content-to-group-users.md) to it.\r\n83. \r\n84. ![user group bulk upload](../media/user-group-bulkupload.gif)\r\n85. \r\n86. Here are some best practices to follow to ease user management on the portal:\r\n87. \r\n88. 1. [**Assign administrators**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md) to delegate administrative tasks like user onboarding and course enrollment to the ground-level facilitator or supervisors. Facilitators/supervisors can track and monitor course activities of all the learners in their group and [**send reminders**](../user-management/manage-users/send-announcement-to-the-users.md) to drive completion.  \r\n89. \r\n90. 2. Leverage user profile information to [**create rules and automatically add users**](../user-management/organize-users/setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1.md) to different groups at the time of sign-up and assign courses.  \r\n91. \r\n92. To learn more about how to manage users on the Community Training management portal, refer to the [**User Management**](../user-management/user-management-overview.md) section of the documentation.\r\n93. \r\n94. ## Step 6 â€?Launch and publish the portal  \r\n95. \r\n96. Once you are done with customizing, uploading content, and adding users to the portal, you're on track to launch the portal for your target audience and start publishing content.  \r\n97. \r\n98. Here are some checklists for you to complete before you proceed with the rollout:\r\n99. \r\n100. 1. [**Customize the certificate template**](../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md) awarded to the learners on course completion.\r\n101. \r\n102. 2. [**Create and publish the mobile app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md) for the learning portal on the Google Play Store.\r\n103. \r\n104. 3. If you want to deliver learning content inside Microsoft Teams, [**create a Teams app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-teams-app-for-your-training-portal.md) and pin it as a Training tab in Microsoft Teams via the Office 365 admin portal.\r\n105. \r\n106. 4. Train the supervisors/facilitators (also called group administrators) on different aspects of the management portal and their roles and responsibilities.\r\n107. \r\n108. 5. Do a soft launch with a limited number of users to make sure the web app and mobile app are working as expected.\r\n109. \r\n110. Once the platform is rolled out to the target audience, you can start publishing the portal for your learners by doing the following:\r\n111. \r\n112. 1. Create and display posters with a QR code in office areas or near lifts.  \r\n113. \r\n114. 2. Broadcast information via email or social media networks (such as WhatsApp messages) with a link to the app.\r\n115. \r\n116. 3. Create excitement and anticipation through contests, prizes, and performance-related incentives.\r\n117. \r\n118. 4. Share a letter from management on the day of the launch encouraging learners to begin to use the platform.\r\n119. \r\n120. The points above are suggestions. You can use any alternative methods you deem fit for your audience.\r\n121. \r\n122. ## Step 7 â€?Track learner engagement and course completion  \r\n123. \r\n124. Once the portal has been rolled out to the learners and they start accessing the course content, you can use the built-in analytics available in the management portal to track course enrollment, completion, and monitor learner activities on the portal.  \r\n125. \r\n126. To view these analytics, go to the **Analytics** tab in the management view of the portal. There you will [**find reports**](../analytics/analytics-overview.md) that provide information on course enrollment across categories and courses, learner performance, content quality, and much more.\r\n127. \r\n128. ![analytics overview](../media/analytics-overview.gif)\r\n129. \r\n130. These reports are important for tracking online learning and help administrators to continuously make improvements to the learning program.\r\n131. \r\n132. \r\n133.

This means that features are only available to users based on whether they have been granted the right permissions.\n \n ![Role-based access](../media/image%28426%29.png)\n \n > [!TIP]  \n > After logging into the management portal, it is recommended to [**add administrators**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md) and delegate portal management and configuration to other users in the organization.\n \n ## Step 3 - Customize the training portal\n \n You can personalize the training portal by configuring various elements of the interface and user settings. To do so, use the **Settings** tab in the management portal:\n \n * You can customize the [**look and feel of the portal**](../settings/customize-the-look-and-feel-of-your-portal.md)  to reflect your organizationâ€™s branding including the portal name, logos, color themes, banners, and messaging.\n \n * You can also [**create additional profile fields**](../settings/add-additional-profile-fields-for-user-information.md) to capture user information at the time of sign-up.\n \n * Lastly, you can [**restrict portal access**](../settings/restrict-portal-access-to-users-outside-your-organization.md) to  unauthorized users and protect your training content.\n \n ![settings overview](../media/settings-overview.gif)\n \n ## Step 4 â€?Upload training content to the portal  \n \n Community Training is optimized for learning with videos for mobile devices â€?even on low-bandwidth or while offline. It provides an easy way for your organization to create and manage online courses, and offer a seamless learning experience.\n \n Courses in Community Training are created under categories. These categories can be based on topics, professions, skills, and more. Courses on the portal will have one or more lessons, non-graded assessments, graded assessments, and certifications.\n \n ![Upload content to portal](../media/Upload%20content%20to%20portal.png)\n \n To add learning material to your training portal, you need to [**define a category**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-category.md)  and [**create courses under that category**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-category.md). You can do this from the **Content Tab** in the management portal. When you create a new course, remember the following:\n \n 1. The course name should be simple and clear. Users should instantly understand the topic of the course when they read the title.\n \n 2. Write a description so your users will have a clear idea of what they will learn in each course.\n \n 3. Upload a customized image relating to the course topic to provide a visual cue to learners. Try to create different thumbnails for each course, to the avoid the redundancy of using the same image.\n \n  Once you have created the courses, [**add learning materials**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/upload-content-to-a-course.md) like videos, PDF files, PowerPoint files, YouTube links, and more. Additionally, [**manage the course options**](../content-management/manage-content/manage-course-category/manage-users-for-a-course.md) according to your needs. Lastly, [**add assessments**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/add-assessments-to-a-course.md) before [**publishing the course**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/publishing-course.md) for your learners.\n \n  ![create course gif](../media/create-course-gif.gif)\n \n > [!TIP]  \n > Use [**bulk upload course**](../content-management/create-content/create-course-category/create-a-new-course.md#option-3---create-multiple-courses-in-a-category) to quickly upload your training content on the portal.\n \n ## Step 5 â€?Create a group and onboard learners to the portal  \n \n Go to the **Users** tab in the management portal to start onboarding learners to the platform. To quickly add learners to the platform, create a CSV file containing the userâ€™s data and [**bulk upload users**](../user-management/organize-users/add-multiple-users-to-the-group.md) to the portal. Bulk upload simplifies the process of adding many users at a time.\n \n In case you have to onboard and manage a large user base, you should also [**create groups**](../user-management/organize-users/create-a-new-group.md) to organize your users based on their job profile, location, designation, and more. Additionally, [**add users**](../user-management/organize-users/create-a-new-group.md#manually-add-users-to-group-during-creation-time) manually into these groups. Once you have added users to a group, you can [**assign courses**](../user-management/manage-users/assign-content-to-group-users.md) to it.\n \n ![user group bulk upload](../media/user-group-bulkupload.gif)\n \n Here are some best practices to follow to ease user management on the portal:\n \n 1. [**Assign administrators**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md) to delegate administrative tasks like user onboarding and course enrollment to the ground-level facilitator or supervisors. Facilitators/supervisors can track and monitor course activities of all the learners in their group and [**send reminders**](../user-management/manage-users/send-announcement-to-the-users.md) to drive completion.  \n \n 2. Leverage user profile information to [**create rules and automatically add users**](../user-management/organize-users/setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1.md) to different groups at the time of sign-up and assign courses.  \n \n To learn more about how to manage users on the Community Training management portal, refer to the [**User Management**](../user-management/user-management-overview.md) section of the documentation.\n \n ## Step 6 â€?Launch and publish the portal  \n \n Once you are done with customizing, uploading content, and adding users to the portal, you're on track to launch the portal for your target audience and start publishing content.  \n \n Here are some checklists for you to complete before you proceed with the rollout:\n \n 1. [**Customize the certificate template**](../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md) awarded to the learners on course completion.\n \n 2. [**Create and publish the mobile app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md) for the learning portal on the Google Play Store.\n \n 3. If you want to deliver learning content inside Microsoft Teams, [**create a Teams app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-teams-app-for-your-training-portal.md) and pin it as a Training tab in Microsoft Teams via the Office 365 admin portal.\n \n 4. Train the supervisors/facilitators (also called group administrators) on different aspects of the management portal and their roles and responsibilities.\n \n 5. Do a soft launch with a limited number of users to make sure the web app and mobile app are working as expected.\n \n Once the platform is rolled out to the target audience, you can start publishing the portal for your learners by doing the following:\n \n 1. Create and display posters with a QR code in office areas or near lifts.  \n \n 2. Broadcast information via email or social media networks (such as WhatsApp messages) with a link to the app.\n \n 3. Create excitement and anticipation through contests, prizes, and performance-related incentives.\n \n 4. Share a letter from management on the day of the launch encouraging learners to begin to use the platform.\n \n The points above are suggestions. You can use any alternative methods you deem fit for your audience.\n \n ## Step 7 â€?Track learner engagement and course completion  \n \n Once the portal has been rolled out to the learners and they start accessing the course content, you can use the built-in analytics available in the management portal to track course enrollment, completion, and monitor learner activities on the portal.  \n \n To view these analytics, go to the **Analytics** tab in the management view of the portal. There you will [**find reports**](../analytics/analytics-overview.md) that provide information on course enrollment across categories and courses, learner performance, content quality, and much more.\n \n ![analytics overview](../media/analytics-overview.gif)\n \n These reports are important for tracking online learning and help administrators to continuously make improvements to the learning program.\n \n \n Please reach out to us [**via HelpDesk**](https://aka.ms/cthelpdesk) if you have any further queries.\n"},"toolTelemetry":{"properties":{"command":"view","options":"{\"truncateBasedOn\":\"tokenCount\",\"truncateStyle\":\"middle\"}","inputs":"[\"path\",\"command\"]","resolvedPathAgainstCwd":"false","fileExtension":".md","viewType":"file"},"metrics":{"resultLength":11631,"resultForLlmLength":11631,"responseTokenLimit":32000},"restrictedProperties":{}}},"id":"01a3581a-ddc8-4ca1-8cd3-50e88dc4d88a","timestamp":"2026-02-04T06:48:58.440Z","parentId":"8dfadc99-3b5f-4a0d-8c68-bdff481d85d7"}

Facilitators/Supervisors can track and monitor course activities of all the learners in their group and [**send reminders**](../user-management/manage-users/send-announcement-to-the-users.md) to drive completion.  \n \n 2. Leverage user profile information to [**create rules and automatically add users**](../user-management/organize-users/setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1.md) to different groups at the time of sign up and assign courses  \n \n To learn more about how to manage users on the Microsoft Community Training management portal, please refer to the [**User Management**](../user-management/user-management-overview.md) section of our product documentation.\n \n ## Step 6 â€?Launch and publicize the portal  \n \n Once you are done with customizing, uploading content and adding users to the portal, you are almost ready to launch the portal for the target audience and start publicizing.  \n \n Here are some checklists for you to complete before you proceed with the rollout:\n \n 1. [**Customize the certificate template**](../settings/customize-the-certificate-template.md) awarded to the learners on the course completion  \n \n 2. [**Create and publish the mobile app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md) for the learning portal on the Google Play Store  \n \n 3. For delivering learning inside Microsoft Teams, [**create a Teams app**](../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-teams-app-for-your-training-portal.md) and pin as Training tab in Microsoft Teams via Office 365 admin portal.\n \n 4. Train the supervisors/facilitators (aka group administrators) on different aspect of the management portal and their roles and responsibilities.\n \n 5. Do a soft launch with limited number of users to make sure the web app and mobile app are working as expected.\n \n Once the platform is rolled out to the target audience, you can start publicizing the portal with your target learners in the following manners:\n \n 1. Create and display posters with QR code in the office area or near the lifts  \n \n 2. Broadcasting information via emailers or social media network (for e.g. WhatsApp messages) with a link to the app\n \n 3. Contests, prizes, performance related incentives create excitement and anticipation\n \n 4. A letter from the management on the day of the launch encouraging learners to begin\n \n The list mentioned above is just indicative. You can use any other method as deemed fit for your audience.\n \n ## Step 7 â€?Track learnerâ€™s engagement and course completion  \n \n Once the portal has been rolled out to the learners and they have started consuming the course content, you can  use the inbuilt analytics available in the management portal to track course enrollment/completion and monitor all learner activities on the portal.  \n \n To view these analytics, go to the **Analytics** tab in the management view of the portal. In this section, you will [**find reports**](../analytics/analytics-overview.md) providing information on course enrollment across categories and courses, learners performance, content quality and much more. You can also create custom reports to analyze specific information using Power BI.\n \n ![analytics overview](../media/analytics-overview.gif)\n \n These reports are important for tracking online learning and helps administrators to iterate and make improvements to the learning program.\n \n"},"toolTelemetry":{"properties":{"command":"view","options":"{\"truncateBasedOn\":\"tokenCount\",\"truncateStyle\":\"middle\"}","inputs":"[\"path\",\"command\"]","resolvedPathAgainstCwd":"false","fileExtension":".md","viewType":"file"},"metrics":{"resultLength":11262,"resultForLlmLength":11262,"responseTokenLimit":32000},"restrictedProperties":{}}},"id":"d0ddd580-ca1e-4e35-b4bf-23d6dab497c9","timestamp":"2026-02-04T06:48:58.441Z","parentId":"01a3581a-ddc8-4ca1-8cd3-50e88dc4d88a"}

The Community Training management portal is your one-stop-shop for all administrative functions like content management, user management, tracking and monitoring training through analytics, portal settings, and more. It's designed based on role-based access control, which means that features are only available to users based on the permissions they've been granted.\r\n14. \r\n15. The features of the management portal are separated into four categories:\r\n16. \r\n17. ![4 categories](../media/image%28423%29.png)\r\n18. \r\n19. ## Types of user roles in Community Training\r\n20. \r\n21. An end-user role can either be a learner or an administrator on the platform. Administrators are responsible for performing activities like content upload, user import, portal customization, analytics, and more on the management portal.\r\n22. \r\n23. To carry out these activities, Community Training provides a role-based hierarchy of administrators. This includes Global Administrators, Organization Administrators, Learning Path Administrators, Category Administrators, Course Administrators, and Group Administrators. Each administrator type is responsible for performing a specific set of actions as described below:\r\n24. \r\n25. ![GetStarted - Role Hierarchy](../media/GetStarted%20-%20Role%20Hierarchy.png)\r\n26. \r\n27. ### 1. Global Administrator\r\n28. \r\n29. This role is assigned to decision-makers or program owners who are responsible for the overall execution, monitoring, and success of the training program. The Global Administrator can use the management portal to create content, manage users, enroll learners in to courses, use reports & analytics, and customize the portal for branding purposes.\r\n30. \r\n31. Here are the steps on [**how to assign global administrator permission to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n32. \r\n33. > [!IMPORTANT]  \r\n34. > Except for portal branding and profile page customization, the global administrator can delegate all the other activities like content management and user management to other administrators on the portal.\r\n35. \r\n36. ### 2. Organization Administrator\r\n37. \r\n38. This role is assigned to owners of a specific organization. An **Organization** in Community Training is a set of learners and administrators who have a particular purpose or share a specific element, such as location, job function, interest, and more. The organization administrator can use the management portal to manage content and users for the organization.\r\n39. \r\n40. Here are the steps on [**how to assign organization administrator permission to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n41. \r\n42. ### 3. Content Administrator\r\n43. \r\n44. This role is assigned to a content expert who is responsible for creating, managing, and reviewing courses on the management portal for the training program. There are two types of Content Administrators in the management portal:\r\n45. \r\n46. #### Learning Path Administrator\r\n47. \r\n48. Learning Path Administrators can create new learning paths using the courses they have been assigned. A user can be a Learning Path Administrator for one or more learning paths on the management portal.\r\n49. \r\n50. Here are the steps on [**how to assign Learning Path Administrator permissions to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n51. \r\n52. #### Category Administrator\r\n53. \r\n54. Category Administrators can create new courses and manage all the existing courses for a given category where they are assigned as administrator. They can also create new categories and manage all the courses within a new category. A user can be a Category Administrator for one or more categories on the management portal.\r\n55. \r\n56. Here are the steps on [**how to assign Category Administrator permissions to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n57. \r\n58. > [!Note]  \r\n59. > Global and Organization Administrators have privileges over other users as Category and Course Administrators on the portal.\r\n60. \r\n61. #### Course Administrator\r\n62. \r\n63. Course Administrators can manage and update content only for courses where they are assigned as administrator.  They can also create new courses and manage all the lessons and assessments within a course. A user can be a Course Administrator for one or more courses on the portal.\r\n64. \r\n65. Here are the steps on [**how to assign Course Administrator permissions to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n66. \r\n67. > [!Note]  \r\n68. > A Category Administrator can also be added as a Course Administrator for a course under a different category in the portal.\r\n69. \r\n70. ### 4.  Group Administrator\r\n71. \r\n72. This role is assigned by a Global Administrator to a grassroots-level facilitator, trainer, supervisor, or manager who is responsible for driving learner engagement and adoption of the training program on the ground. The Group Administrator takes care of onboarding users, assigning courses, and driving course completion via announcements or discussion forums.\r\n73. \r\n74. Here are the steps on [**how to assign Group Administrator permissions to a user**](../user-management/add-users/add-an-administrator-to-the-portal.md).\r\n75. \r\n76. > [!Note]  \r\n77. > A user can have more than one administrative role on the portal. For example, a user can be both a Course Administrator and a Group Administrator.\r\n78. \r\n79. ### 5. Learner\r\n80. \r\n81. This is the default role assigned to any user added to the portal. Users with this role permission can only view and consume the learning content. They donâ€™t have access to the administrative functionalities on the platform.\r\n82. \r\n83. Here are steps on [how to navigate the portal as a Learner](../learner-experience/web-app.md).\r\n84. \r\n85. > [!IMPORTANT]    \r\n86. > There is no restriction on the number of users you can add in the portal for a given administrative role.

This article shows you how to enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure AD organization using a user flow in Azure AD B2C.\r\n14. \r\n15. >[!NOTE]\r\n16. >We Recommend that you configure Multi Factor Authentication for your instance. This will help enhance the security of the platform.\r\n17. \r\n18. ## Step:1 Register an Azure AD app\r\n19. \r\n20. To enable sign-in for users with an Azure AD account from a specific Azure AD organization,  you need to create an application in [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) from your Azure Active Directory B2C account (Azure AD B2C). For more information, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).\r\n21. \r\n22. 1. Sign in to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/).\r\n23. 1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your organizational Azure AD tenant (for example, contoso.com). Select the **Directory + subscription filter** in the top menu, and then choose the directory that contains your Azure AD tenant.\r\n24. 1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **App registrations**.\r\n25. 1. Select **New registration**.\r\n26. 1. Enter a **Name** for your application. For example, Azure AD B2C App.\r\n27. 1. Accept the default selection of **Accounts in this organizational directory only** for this application.\r\n28. 1. For the **Redirect URI**, accept the value of **Web**, and enter the following URL in all lowercase letters, where ***your-B2C-tenant-name*** is replaced with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant.\r\n29. \r\n30.     `https://your-B2C-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-B2C-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`\r\n31. \r\n32.      <!--If you use a [custom domain](setup-custom-domain-url.md), enter `https://your-domain-name/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. Replace ***your-domain-name*** with your custom domain, and ***your-tenant-name*** with the name of your tenant.-->\r\n33. 1. Select **Register** and record the **Application (client) ID** for use in a later step.\r\n34. 1. Select **Certificates & secrets**, then **New client secret**.\r\n35. 1. Enter a **Description** for the secret, select an expiration, then select **Add** and record the **Value** of the secret for use in a later step.\r\n36. \r\n37. ## Step 2: Configure Azure AD as an identity provider\r\n38. \r\n39. 1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains Azure AD B2C tenant. Select the **Directory + subscription** filter in the top menu and choose the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.\r\n40. 1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.\r\n41. 1. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **New OpenID Connect provider**.\r\n42. 1. Enter a **Name**, for example enter *firstAD*.\r\n43. 1. For **Metadata url**, enter the following URL replacing {tenant} with the domain name of your Azure AD tenant:\r\n44.     `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\r\n45. \r\n46.     **For example:**\r\n47.     - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\r\n48.     - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\r\n49. \r\n50. 1. For **Client ID**, enter the application ID that you previously recorded.\r\n51. 1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret that you previously recorded.\r\n52. 1. For **Scope**, enter the *openid* profile.\r\n53. 1. Leave the default values for **Response type**, and **Response mode**.\r\n54. 1. For the **Domain hint**, which is optional, enter contoso.com. For more information, see [Set up direct sign-in using Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/direct-signin?pivots=b2c-user-flow#redirect-sign-in-to-a-social-provider).\r\n55. 1. Under **Identity provider claims mapping**, select the following claims(refer the below screenshot):\r\n56.     - **User ID**: *sub*\r\n57.     - **Display name**: *name*\r\n58.     - **Given name**: *given_name*\r\n59.     - **Surname**: *family_name*\r\n60.     - **Email**: *preferred_username*\r\n61. \r\n62.     ![Configure custom IDP](../../media/MultipleAAD1.png)\r\n63. 1. Select **Save**.\r\n64. \r\n65. ## Step 3: Add Azure AD identity provider to a user flow\r\n66. \r\n67. At this point, the Azure AD identity provider has been set up but is not available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the Azure AD identity provider to a user flow:\r\n68. \r\n69. 1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.\r\n70. 1. Select the user flow that you want to add to the Azure AD identity provider.\r\n71. 1. Under **Identity providers**, select the Social and Custom Identity Providers required. Refer to the below screenshot.\r\n72.     ![Social Identity Providers](../../media/MultipleAAD2.png)\r\n73. 1. Select **Save**.\r\n74. 1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.\r\n75. 1. For **Application**, select the web application that you previously registered.\r\n76. 1.

For more information or support, please reach out to our team here: https://aka.ms/cthelpdesk\n # Add multiple Azure AD(single tenant) to B2C as social account\n \n This article shows you how to enable sign-in for users from a specific Azure AD organization using a user flow in Azure AD B2C.\n \n >[!NOTE]\n >We Recommend that you configure Multi Factor Authentication for your instance. This will help enhance the security of the platform.\n \n ## Step:1 Register an Azure AD app\n \n To enable sign-in for users with an Azure AD account from a specific Azure AD organization,  you need to create an application in [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/) from your Azure Active Directory B2C account (Azure AD B2C). For more information, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).\n \n 1. Sign in to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com/).\n 1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your organizational Azure AD tenant (for example, contoso.com). Select the **Directory + subscription filter** in the top menu, and then choose the directory that contains your Azure AD tenant.\n 1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **App registrations**.\n 1. Select **New registration**.\n 1. Enter a **Name** for your application. For example, Azure AD B2C App.\n 1. Accept the default selection of **Accounts in this organizational directory only** for this application.\n 1. For the **Redirect URI**, accept the value of **Web**, and enter the following URL in all lowercase letters, where ***your-B2C-tenant-name*** is replaced with the name of your Azure AD B2C tenant.\n \n     `https://your-B2C-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-B2C-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`\n \n      <!--If you use a [custom domain](setup-custom-domain-url.md), enter `https://your-domain-name/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. Replace ***your-domain-name*** with your custom domain, and ***your-tenant-name*** with the name of your tenant.-->\n 1. Select **Register** and record the **Application (client) ID** for use in a later step.\n 1. Select **Certificates & secrets**, then **New client secret**.\n 1. Enter a **Description** for the secret, select an expiration, then select **Add** and record the **Value** of the secret for use in a later step.\n \n ## Step 2: Configure Azure AD as an identity provider\n \n 1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains Azure AD B2C tenant. Select the **Directory + subscription** filter in the top menu and choose the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.\n 1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.\n 1. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **New OpenID Connect provider**.\n 1. Enter a **Name**, for example enter *firstAD*.\n 1. For **Metadata url**, enter the following URL replacing {tenant} with the domain name of your Azure AD tenant:\n     `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n \n     **For example:**\n     - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n     - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n \n 1. For **Client ID**, enter the application ID that you previously recorded.\n 1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret that you previously recorded.\n 1. For **Scope**, enter the *openid* profile.\n 1. Leave the default values for **Response type**, and **Response mode**.\n 1. For the **Domain hint**, which is optional, enter contoso.com. For more information, see [Set up direct sign-in using Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/direct-signin?pivots=b2c-user-flow#redirect-sign-in-to-a-social-provider).\n 1. Under **Identity provider claims mapping**, select the following claims(refer the below screenshot):\n     - **User ID**: *sub*\n     - **Display name**: *name*\n     - **Given name**: *given_name*\n     - **Surname**: *family_name*\n     - **Email**: *preferred_username*\n \n     ![Configure custom IDP](../../media/MultipleAAD1.png)\n 1. Select **Save**.\n \n ## Step 3: Add Azure AD identity provider to a user flow\n \n At this point, the Azure AD identity provider has been set up but is not available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the Azure AD identity provider to a user flow:\n \n 1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.\n 1. Select the user flow that you want to add to the Azure AD identity provider.\n 1. Under **Identity providers**, select the Social and Custom Identity Providers required. Refer to the below screenshot.\n     ![Social Identity Providers](../../media/MultipleAAD2.png)\n 1. Select **Save**.\n 1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.\n 1. For **Application**, select the web application that you previously registered.\n 1. Select the **Run user flow** button.\n 1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select Contoso Azure AD to sign in with Azure AD Contoso account.\n \n If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to <https://jwt.ms>, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.\n \n"},"toolTelemetry":{"properties":{"command":"view","options":"{\"truncateBasedOn\":\"tokenCount\",\"truncateStyle\":\"middle\"}","inputs":"[\"path\",\"view_range\",\"command\"]","resolvedPathAgainstCwd":"false","fileExtension":".md","viewType":"file"},"metrics":{"resultLength":6159,"resultForLlmLength":6159,"responseTokenLimit":32000},"restrictedProperties":{}}},"id":"0499e661-a441-4c53-b44a-8978fe529170","timestamp":"2026-02-04T06:49:41.007Z","parentId":"2f956d00-c398-41da-927b-943ccb1e310d"}

Community Training is a cloud-based solution that enables delivery of large-scale, far-spread training programs with high quality and efficiency. Community Training is an Azure-powered online learning platform to enable organizations of all sizes and types to run large scale training programs for their internal and external communities such as first line workers, extended workforces, partner ecosystem, volunteer network, program beneficiaries, etc.\r\n18. \r\n19. This article describes reliability support in Community Training, and covers  both regional resiliency with [availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli) and [disaster recovery and business continuity](/azure/reliability/disaster-recovery-overview). For a more detailed overview of a reliability principles in Azure, see [Azure reliability](/azure/reliability/overview).\r\n20. \r\n21. ## Availability zone support\r\n22. \r\n23. ### Control Plane\r\n24. The control plane is zone redundant in the primary regions of availability.\r\n25. \r\n26. ### Data Plane\r\n27. Azure availability zones are physical locations within an Azure region that provide increased high availability and protection against datacenter failures. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking.\r\n28. [Go here for further details](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview).\r\n29. \r\n30. Community Training uses Azure availability zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance within an Azure region.\r\n31. It offers both Zonal and zone-redundant high availability. Customer can choose either of the redundancy options.\r\n32. \r\n33. ### Prerequisites\r\n34. \r\n35. Community Training offers following SKU:\r\n36. 1. Standard (lower scale of users )\r\n37. 1. Premium (high scale of users )\r\n38. \r\n39. List of regions where community training will be supported:\r\n40. \r\n41. | Americas         | Europe               | Middle East   | Africa             | Asia Pacific   |\r\n42. |------------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|\r\n43. | West US 2        | UK South             |               |                    | Southeast Asia |\r\n44. | South Central US | West Europe          |               |                    | Australia East |\r\n45. | East US 2        | North Europe         |               |                    |                |\r\n46. | East US          | Sweden Central       |               |                    |                |\r\n47. | West US 3        |                      |               |                    |                |\r\n48. \r\n49. \r\n50. Note: In the secondary region, zonal availability will be provided.\r\n51. \r\n52. \r\n53. ### Zonal failover support\r\n54. Community Training provide configuration for redundancy at the time of creation. \r\n55. Customer should choose zone-redundant high availability to avoid any zonal failure. \r\n56. Community Training internally uses standard Azure services like App service, Azure SQL etc.\r\n57. Choosing zonal redunancy option will create zonal redundant offering of underlying azure resources which will take care of the fault tolerance.\r\n58. \r\n59. \r\n60. ### Zone down experience\r\n61. **Zonal**\r\n62. \r\n63. If customer configures Community training as zonal and if any zone is down then Community Training will not be available during the zone down. Service availabitlity depend on various factors (datacenter down, specific service not available in that zone etc), either complete service or part of features may not be available. \r\n64. \r\n65. **Zone redundant**\r\n66. \r\n67. In a zone-wide outage scenario, users should experience no impact on provisioned resources in a zone-redundant deployment. \r\n68. During a zone-wide outage, customers should be prepared to experience a brief interruption in communication with provisioned resources. Clients typically receive 409 error codes in this situation, and retry logic attempts to re-establish connections at appropriate intervals. New requests are directed to healthy nodes with zero impact on the user. During zone-wide outages, users are able to create new resources and successfully scale existing ones.\r\n69. \r\n70. ## Disaster recovery and business continuity\r\n71. \r\n72. ### Control Plane:\r\n73. \r\n74. Regions with paired regions: The control plane will be manually failed over to the paired region in case of a disaster. The service might experience degradation in the time before the failover occurs. After the failover, only read-only operations will be supported until the disaster region is back online. The service will be manually failed back to the original region once it is back online and all operations will resume.\r\n75. Regions without paired regions: The product is not available in regions without paired regions.\r\n76. \r\n77. RPO: 10 minutes\r\n78. \r\n79. RTO: 24 hours*\r\n80.

Service availabitlity depend on various factors (datacenter down, specific service not available in that zone etc), either complete service or part of features may not be available. \n \n **Zone redundant**\n \n In a zone-wide outage scenario, users should experience no impact on provisioned resources in a zone-redundant deployment. \n During a zone-wide outage, customers should be prepared to experience a brief interruption in communication with provisioned resources. Clients typically receive 409 error codes in this situation, and retry logic attempts to re-establish connections at appropriate intervals. New requests are directed to healthy nodes with zero impact on the user. During zone-wide outages, users are able to create new resources and successfully scale existing ones.\n \n ## Disaster recovery and business continuity\n \n ### Control Plane:\n \n Regions with paired regions: The control plane will be manually failed over to the paired region in case of a disaster. The service might experience degradation in the time before the failover occurs. After the failover, only read-only operations will be supported until the disaster region is back online. The service will be manually failed back to the original region once it is back online and all operations will resume.\n Regions without paired regions: The product is not available in regions without paired regions.\n \n RPO: 10 minutes\n \n RTO: 24 hours*\n \n"},"toolTelemetry":{"properties":{"command":"view","options":"{\"truncateBasedOn\":\"tokenCount\",\"truncateStyle\":\"middle\"}","inputs":"[\"path\",\"view_range\",\"command\"]","resolvedPathAgainstCwd":"false","fileExtension":".md","viewType":"file"},"metrics":{"resultLength":5807,"resultForLlmLength":5807,"responseTokenLimit":32000},"restrictedProperties":{}}},"id":"4ef523fa-3b3d-42c9-b16c-dc8f071b7777","timestamp":"2026-02-04T06:51:20.769Z","parentId":"9e909c68-98e1-456b-a670-4ddb427f8931"}

If you are managing multiple instances of the Community Training platform, each catering to different target audiences but with overlapping course content, there is an easy way for administrators to move content across instances.\r\n13. \r\n14. Community Training allows you to download single or multiple courses within a category from one platform instance in a ready to use zip file that can be uploaded to another instance.\r\n15. \r\n16. In this article, you will learn how to export course content from one training portal instance and import the same course content to another instance.\r\n17. \r\n18. ## Step 1 - Export course content from a training portal instance\r\n19. \r\n20. 1. Log on to the Community Training portal instance from where you want to download the course content then [**switch to administrator view**](../../../get-started/step-by-step-configuration-guide.md#step-2--switch-to-administrator-view-of-the-portal).\r\n21. \r\n22. 1. Under the **Courses** tab, select the Category or Course that you want to download.\r\n23. \r\n24.     ![Under courses tab](../../../media/image%28219%29.png)\r\n25. \r\n26. 1. Select **(...) More** and choose **Download category/course content** from the pop-up menu.\r\n27. \r\n28. 1. On the file explorer, rename the zip file and click on the Save button to start the download progress. The time taken to download will vary depending on the file size and internet speed.\r\n29. \r\n30.     ![Save](../../../media/image%28220%29.png)\r\n31. \r\n32. > [!TIP]  \r\n33. > Best Practices\r\n34. >\r\n35. > 1. If the courses for a given category are small in size (i.e. total size of category courses is less than 2 GB), then export all the courses for the category together i.e. select the category and choose the download category content option.\r\n36. > 1. If the courses for a given category are large in size, then export courses individually under the category i.e. select a course under given category and choose the download course content.\r\n37. \r\n38. > [!WARNING]  \r\n39. > Please do not edit the downloaded file as this can inadvertently corrupt the course content. Here is sample format of the zip file:\r\n40. >\r\n41. > ![Sample zip](../../../media/image%28221%29.png)\r\n42. \r\n43. ## Step 2 - Import the course content to another training portal instance\r\n44. \r\n45. 1. Log on to the Community Training portal instance where you want to upload the course content and [**switch to administrator view**](../../../get-started/step-by-step-configuration-guide.md#step-2--switch-to-administrator-view-of-the-portal).\r\n46. \r\n47. 1. Under **Courses** tab, [**create a new category**](../../create-content/create-course-category/create-a-category.md) or select the existing category you want to upload the content to.\r\n48. \r\n49. 1. Select **(...) More** then **Bulk Upload courses** from the pop-up menu.\r\n50. \r\n51.     ![Bulk Upload courses](../../../media/image%28222%29.png)\r\n52. \r\n53. 1.
